# Output Files Generated by SPAdes Genome Assembly

After running `SPAdes` for genome assembly, you typically get several output files which provide different perspectives and details about the assembly process. Here's a brief overview of each commonly generated file:

`contigs.fasta`: This file contains the assembled contigs, which are contiguous sequences of DNA that are derived from overlapping reads.

`contigs.paths`: In SPAdes, this file typically shows the paths through the assembly graph that correspond to the contigs. It helps understand how contigs are connected in the assembly process.

`scaffolds.fasta`: This file contains the assembled scaffolds, which are larger sequences constructed from contigs based on paired-end read information and other data. Scaffolds represent a more complete picture of the genome than individual contigs.

`scaffolds.paths`: Similar to contigs.paths, this file shows the paths through the assembly graph corresponding to the scaffolds. It provides insights into the structure and connectivity of the genome as inferred by SPAdes.

`assembly_graph_with_scaffolds.gfa`: This file represents the assembly graph. It uses the Graphical Fragment Assembly (GFA) format to show the relationships between contigs and/or scaffolds. Scaffolds are ordered and oriented sets of contigs that represent the inferred structure of the genome. Visualization tools like `Bandage` can be used to interpret this output effectively.
`assembly_graph_after_simplification.gfa`: Similar to the previous file, but this one simplified redundant or overlapping sequences. .

`spades.log`: This log file records the details of the SPAdes run, including parameters used, warnings encountered, and general information about the assembly process. It can be helpful for troubleshooting and understanding the specifics of the assembly run.

Each of these output files serves a specific purpose in the genome assembly process, from providing detailed sequences (contigs and scaffolds) to illustrating the assembly graph and its simplification steps. Together, they offer a comprehensive view of how SPAdes has processed the input data to reconstruct the genome.
